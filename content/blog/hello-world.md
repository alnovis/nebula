Welcome to my new blog! This site is built with modern web technologies while keeping things simple and fast.

## The Stack

This blog is powered by:

- **Rust** with **Axum** - A fast, ergonomic web framework
- **HTMX** - Server-side interactivity without heavy JavaScript
- **Askama** - Compile-time checked templates
- **PostgreSQL** - Reliable database for analytics

## Why Rust?

I wanted to learn Rust by building something practical. A personal website is perfect:
- It's a real project with real requirements
- Performance matters (first impressions count)
- I get to explore the Rust ecosystem

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about:
- Software engineering practices
- Interesting projects I'm working on
- Lessons learned from production systems

Stay tuned for more posts!
